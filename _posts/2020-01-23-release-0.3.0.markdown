Two major additions are included in this release: reporting
the breakdown of solution objective terms and contact force tracking.

When using MocoCasADiSolver, MocoSolution now provides a breakdown of
the terms in the objective. The portions of the total objective for all
terms (including their weights) can be accessed by the methods
getObjectiveTerm() and getObjectiveTermByIndex() on MocoSolution, and
are also printed to the command line or console window upon arriving at
a solution.

MocoContactTrackingGoal was added, allowing minimization of error
between model compliant contact forces and experimentally measured
contact force data. Currently, this goal does not track torques or
centers of pressure, and only supports the SmoothSphereHalfSpaceForce
contact element included with Moco.

Other minor changes in this release include renaming exampleSitToStand
to exampleSquatToStand, moving the bisection root solver in
DeGrooteFregly2016Muscle to a dedicated utility in MocoUtilities, and
a bug fix in the report.py report generation tool related to the
STOFileAdapter no longer have a read() method due to a recent change
in OpenSim's API.

These changes, and changes from previous releases, are reflected in the
[CHANGELOG.md file](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-moco/blob/0.3.0/CHANGELOG.md).
