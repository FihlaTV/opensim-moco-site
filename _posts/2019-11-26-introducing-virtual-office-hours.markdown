We are excited to pilot a new way of providing support for Moco: Virtual Office
Hours. Chatting in real-time allows users to get quick and effective help.
Virtual Office Hours are 30-minute video conference calls with one or more
members of the Moco team. These calls are open to users with any level of
experience with Moco, but are intended for two types of support: 

- Determine if Moco can help with a given research question, and learn how to
apply Moco to this question.
- Troubleshoot complex errors or issues with optimizer convergence for a
given problem.

For straightforward questions, use [Moco's SimTK
forum](https://simtk.org/plugins/phpBB/indexPhpbb.php?group_id=1815&pluginname=phpBB)
instead.

If you are interested, complete our [Request for OpenSim Moco Virtual Office Hours form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBnG4wGNAanEQCfDRudxQHJviTFvtEYU_0mfU387u8aAHq8w/viewform).

The Moco team will evaluate the submission and respond to requests according to
their suitability for Virtual Office Hours, the order in which we receive them,
and our availability.

We aim to start the office hours in December 2019. If you are selected for
office hours, we will contact you with a list of time slots during business
hours, Pacific Time.

We request that participants in the Virtual Office Hours make a small
contribution back to the Moco project within three weeks after the conference
call. Here are examples of how you might contribute:

- Write a forum post explaining your questions and what you learned.
- Submit example code (either in a forum post or on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-moco)).
- Improve the documentation (see
  [Moco/doc](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-moco/tree/master/Moco/doc)
  on GitHub).
