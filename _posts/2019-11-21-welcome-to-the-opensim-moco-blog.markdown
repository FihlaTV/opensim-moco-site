OpenSim Moco is a new part of the OpenSim project for solving optimal control
problems with OpenSim musculoskeletal models. Moco can solve a wide range of
problems, from estimating muscles forces to predicting new motions, without
requiring users to have expertise in optimal control methods. Moco is created
by the Stanford University Neuromuscular Biomechanics Lab, where OpenSim is
developed.
